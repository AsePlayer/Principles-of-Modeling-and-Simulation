# Principles of Modeling and Simulation
 
This course covers applications of differential equations in modeling and simulation. Students use mathematical models for continuous and discrete simulation, and develop applications for complex systems across a variety of domains. Students learn how to represent a system by a model and then execute the model to generate and statistically analyze data. The laboratory reinforces and expands learning of principles introduced in the lecture. Hands-on activities focus on writing code that implements differential equation based modeling algorithms and visual simulations. Prerequisite: CST-201, CST-215, MAT-264.
