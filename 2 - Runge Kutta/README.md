# Runge Kutta for ODE

## Purpose
This project implements and compares the Runge-Kutta method for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with the optimized `odeint` solver from SciPy. It aimed to evaluate the precision and performance of both methods and visualize the results through graphs.

## Key Features
- **Runge-Kutta Algorithm**: Custom method to solve ODEs.
- **`odeint` Solver**: Comparison using SciPy's built-in function.
- **Visualization**: Results graphed using Matplotlib.
- **Performance Optimization**: Explored improvements using rounding and Numba.

## Challenges & Solutions
- Ensuring accuracy with Runge-Kutta compared to `odeint`.
- Investigated performance enhancements like rounding and using Numba for optimization.

## Outcome
The project highlighted the differences in precision and computational speed between the custom Runge-Kutta method and `odeint`, providing valuable insights into the efficiency and accuracy trade-offs for solving ODEs.
